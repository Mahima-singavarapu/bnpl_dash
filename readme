BNPL stands for Buy Now, Pay Later, a flexible payment method letting customers buy products immediately and pay in installments later, often interest-free, by splitting the cost into smaller, manageable payments over time. It acts as a short-term loan, with the BNPL provider paying the merchant upfront and the customer repaying the provider in installments, making large purchases more affordable and improving cash flow. 

The Buy Now Pay Later dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bdoey1/bnpl-data-v1/data
